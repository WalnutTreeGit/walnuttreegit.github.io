Hi! I'm João Paulo, a DPhil applicant for the **Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems (AIMS) CDT** at the University of Oxford for the 2026 intake. I currently hold an MSc in **Computer Science for Networks** from **Institut Polytechnique de Paris**  and a BSc in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** from the **Polytechnic Institute of Porto**.

My proposed research direction is **Adaptive Invariant Synthesis**, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level control guarantees. I am driven by the paradigm of **Embodied Intelligence** and the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Specifically, I aim to use Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) not just for planning, but as structured label generators that synthesize formal safety constraints from deployment experience. This direction is directly aligned with the work of the **Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI)** and **Oxford Control and Verification (OXCAV)** groups.

Most recently, I was a **Machine Learning Research Intern** at **Nokia Bell Labs** (Paris), where I proposed "Certainty-Guided Reasoning," a framework for dynamic thinking budgets in LLMs. This work was selected for the **Outstanding Innovation Award** at the Nokia Bell Labs Global Student Program (2025). Prior to this, I worked as a Robotics R&D Intern at **INESC TEC**, building LiDAR drivers and mapping tools for agricultural field robots.

My ultimate goal is to secure a permanent position in an academic or industrial research lab, contributing to autonomous systems that can safely learn from their own failures.

### Research Interests

* **Robotics & Autonomy:** VLA models, Embodied Intelligence, Long-Term Autonomy, Semantic Failure Recovery.
* **Formal Methods:** SMT-based Constraint Learning, Adaptive Safety Shields.
* **Machine Learning:** Inference-time reasoning, Uncertainty quantification, Efficient LLMs.
